After the first lesson I couldn't think of any good joke about it, so I asked ChatGPT to help me. Seeing that its idea was not only better than mine but also appropriate for the situation made me understand why "The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better" is an outdated definition.

"The irony of the first lecture: we spent half the time learning how not to mess up the assignmentsâ€¦ and then, of course, I messed up the first one."
